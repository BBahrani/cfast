#Version History
	
##Version 6.2.0 (October 31, 2011)
	
        
Added plume centerline temperature calculation from work of McCaffrey, Heskestad, and Evans. This is
now used for the surrounding gas temperature for target calculations. Note that at this 
point, it only impacts targets directly over a fire source.
        
Updated spreadsheet column headings to be more readable and useful, including units. This also added
the option for a net heat flux output (now the default) for all target heat flux outputs.
        
Added cylindrical targets largely aimed at improving calculation of heat flux to and temperature of
wire and cable targets.
        
General code cleanup, verification, and validation.  This included removal of numerous unused variables that were
 left over from earlier features long since removed from the model.  Code logic analysis with
Forcheck to ensure call and variable consistency, additional and repeated validation tests.
        
Added detailed discussion of CFAST's fire chemistry and target calculations to Technical Reference Guide.  Updated
User's Guide and Validation Guide for latest version.
	

##Version 6.1.1 (Febrary 4, 2009)
        
Added a new species, labeled TS, to track flow through compartments. TS is a trace
species produce during pyrolysis and is not affected by combustion. The assumption
is that molecules are large enough to be filtered, but that mass is small compared
to the overall pyrolysis. See NISTIR 7498 for an example of its use.
        
Added the ability to specify filtering for mechanical ventilation systems which
applies to soot and the trace species. For the user, it is implemented wtih the
EVENT,F command and available through the GUI. See the User’s Guide, NIST Special
Publication 1041 (May 2008 Revision) for details.
        
        
Separated pyrolysis and combustion kinetics. The original purpose was to fix a bug
related to pyrolysis products not being transported to the upper layer when a fire
is only in the upper layer. The code was structured so that a consistent combustion
model for a plume could be implemented. Species affected only by pyrolysis are hydrogren
choloride, hydrogen cyanide, trace species and the concentration time product. Species
affected only by kinetics are carbon-dioxide, carbon-monoxide, and soot. Species
affected by both are oxygen and fuel. Nitrogen is inert and only transported.
        
Corrected error in mechanical ventilation that prevented flow from dropping off
at high pressures like it was supposed too. An additional error casued DASSL to
fail at times when the mechanical ventilatino system shut off due to (the now corrected)
high pressure cutoff. The solution was to not totally close the vent (the
vent is left open at an extremely small value, machine epsilson for double precision) Corrected error in exehandle routine that caused
model to fail with path names longer than 128 characters (windows limit is 255 characters
for whole file name).
Corrected error in interpolation routines for opening and closing vents that did
not smoothly transistion from open to closed (Since the GUI did this over 1 s, the
impact should not be noticeable for previously run cases).
        
Incorporated Heskestad plume model as an alternative to the McCaffrey plume model
(type 2). There is a small difference in the calculated results for a range
of test cases (on the order of 2% to 4%). The plan is to add plume temperature
to the calculation as well.
	
Smokeview updated to improve visualization of vent flows (now accounts for vent opening and closing)
and smoke (3-D smoke visualization now an option that depends on calculation optical density).
        
Corrected error in the GUI that incorrectly outputs the mechanical ventilation specification
for the CFAST model. The fifth parameter on the line specifies a "system number"
for each mechanical ventilation system. In older versions, this began with
1 for each compartment rather than being numbered sequentially throughout.
The impact was that opening and closing of vents would not work when there were
mechanical ventilation fans in more than one compartment. Calculation was
correct for fully-opened mechanical vents.
        
        
##Version 6.0.10 (January 11, 2007)
        
Beginning with version 6.0.10, CFAST and CEdit were compiled with Visual Studio
2005. This means that both new and existing users of earlier versions of the
Windows CFAST will need to download and install Microsoft .NET version 2.0 (included
in the larger download of CFAST) if it is not already installed on their computer.
        
Corrected subscript error in cfast input checking for ceiling-floor conduction connections
that caused an error with simulations with 5 or more compartments. Corrected an
error in the definition of fire objects to allow radiative fraction to be zero,
not just greater than zero. Corrected a display error for CFAST files in smokeview
that placed fires in the wrong compartment for visualization; calculations, spreadsheet,
and printed output were correct.
        
Updated the GUI to Visual Studio 2005, including spreadsheet, auto-sizing, and preview
libraries.
Reversed order of CFAST log file in the message summary so that any errors would
appear at the top of the list, more visible to the user. Changed limit on number
of mechanical ventilation connections from 10 to 100. Corrected an error that prevented
saving of an input file when compartments were removed from a simulation. Corrected
an error that caused incorrect values for default fire position when engineering
units were not set to m. Fixed compartment naming when a compartment is duplicated.
Corrected an error when defining a new fire that did not assign a material to
the fire (leading to an error 205 when running CFAST). Enabled RTI input for heat alarms
(Previously, heat alarms were presumed to have a default value for
the RTI). Corrected a subscript error that caused GUI error message for a compartment
specified as a single zone if the compartment was the highest numbered compartment
in the simulation.
        
Added the ability to define a general t-squared growth rate fire to the Edit Fire
Objects window, allowing the user to select growth rate, peak HRR, steady burning
time, and decay time, including predefined constants for slow, medium, fast, and
ultra-fast t-squared fires. Added the ability to add and remove thermal properties
on the thermal properties edit window. Redesigned the heat transfer connection tab to separate
horizontal and vertical heat transfer specifications to allow for future enhancement
of the horizontal connections to better support the HHEAT keyword in CFAST; for
the moment, only a single, fractional connection is allowed on a given keyword
line. Note that vertical heat transfer always assumes a fraction of one
for the connection.
        
        
##Version 6.0.9 (May 15, 2006)

Corrected error in CFAST where ignition time of a fire was off by 1 s when 
specified ignition time was t = 0 s.

Corrected error in specification of alternate thermal property files that would 
not allow reading of the alternate files nor set file changed flag when file 
was changed. Corrected links to GUI text boxes for HCl constants 2 through 7 
that prevented editing of these constants. Corrected size of summary 
spreadsheets in the GUI to be consistent with CFAST design limits. This 
would cause the program to crash if you had more than 50 vents or targets in a 
single simulation. Heat source fire on Fires tab was not actually implemented in the model; this 
has been removed from the GUI. Corrected units in the GUI for HCl and HCN. They were listed as kg/s by 
default rather thankg/kg (dimensionless). This would lead to incorrect 
species yields for simulations with user selected units other than kg for mass 
and s for time.
		
##Version 6.0.8 (February 28, 2006)

Corrected errors in the calculation of unburned fuel that caused the 
fuel not to burn in compartments remote from the fire room. Ignition 
temperature for doorway fires is now a global parameter that is entered on the 
Fires tab of the input program.

Beginning with version 6.0.8, default installation locations for 
program files and user data files follow the Windows model so that executable 
files are typically located in "C:\Program Files\CFAST" and user data files are 
located in "MyDocuments\CFASTData." If upgrading from an earlier version 
of the software, the installation program removes older executable files, but 
leaves existing data files in their original location. If desired, the 
files can be moved to the new data directory created during installation of the 
software.

		
##Version 6.0.7 (February 1, 2006)
		
Corrected an error in the horizontal flow routine that prevented printout of 
vent flow values for some vents

Corrected error in the GUI where corridor flow coefficients were incorrectly 
assigned a default value of 0 rather than the CFAST assumed value of -1. 
This caused erroneous calculation of corridor flows allowing excessive 
temperatures in hallways to be calculated.
		
##Version 6.0.5 (October 1, 2005)
		
Add target normal calculation to cedit, and extend object plotting in GUI to all 
object variables. Add error checking for objects and detectors placed outside 
of a compartment. Fix ceiling jet coordinates so that they agree with targets.

An inconsistent labeling of width, depth and height caused incorrect target flux 
calculations.

The initial/final open fraction for vertical flow and mechanical flow were not 
being set correctly. Both have been fixed.
		
The ambient flux calculations seem to be too high. The problem lies in 
specification of object properties. The fire has to release energy over a 
finite volume. As the size of this volume is reduced, the energy per unit 
volume goes up and thus the heat flux rises. There is a physical limit on the 
maximum such energy release per unit volume. As pointed out by Orloff and deRis 
("Froude Modeling of Pool Fires," Factory Mutual Technical Report OHON3.BU, 
Norwood (1983)), there is a physical limit on the maximum such energy release 
per unit volume. This limitation arises because mixing and diffusion take a 
finite amount of time, and radiation is limited by optical depth, at least for 
fires of the sort we consider in CFAST, namely buoyant diffusion flames. The 
upper limit is 1.2 MW/m3. An object model which is the area of the object as 
defined in the database (.o) and the height extent which includes a maximum 
flame length is used to make this estimate. The input routine, INPUTOBJECT, 
does this calculation, with a warning at 2 MW/m3, and a stop with the error 
code 221 at 4 MW/m3. The minimum object volume is now 1.0x10-6 m3.

		
##Version 6.0.1 (June 1, 2005)
		
Initial release of version 6 of CFAST, including a Windows version of the CEdit 
graphical user interface. Fires are now treated as objects, which can be placed 
and sized within compartments. Mechanical ventilation has been simplified to 
fan/opening pairs, and all vents (vertical flow, horizontal flow and forced 
flow) can be turned off or on (single instance).
